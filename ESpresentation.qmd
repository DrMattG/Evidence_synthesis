## What is evidence synthesis?

### 

[...the process of bringing together information from a range of sources and disciplines to inform debates and decisions on specific issues. Decision-making and public debate are best served if policymakers have access to the **best current evidence** on an issue](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/evidence-synthesis/#:~:text=%27Evidence%20synthesis%27%20refers%20to%20the,current%20evidence%20on%20an%20issue. "Royal Society Definition").

## 1. What types of questions can you ask?

::: panel-tabset
### What is the state of the evidence?

"What research evidence is there that humans are exposed to and affected by AMR in the environment?"

### What is the effect of an intervention/exposure on a population?

"How do changes in flow magnitude due to hydroelectric power production affect fish abundance and diversity in temperate regions?"

### How can we generalise the best evidence to a larger population/spatial extent?

Greenspaces & human health benefits - multiple systematic reviews but no over-arching understanding of the effects
:::

## Use question frameworks (e.g. PICO)

***Subject (population)***---freshwater and estuarine fish in temperate regions.

***Intervention/exposure***---changes to (or manipulations of) flow magnitude due to hydroelectric production.

***Comparator***---no intervention or alternate levels of intervention.

***Outcomes***---measures of changes in abundance (broadly defined in terms of abundance, density, biomass, yield, etc.) and diversity (broadly defined in terms of species richness, diversity, etc.)

## Method overview

*Systematic review/Meta-analysis - not just a review done systematically*

## ***Systematic Map vs Systematic Review***

*Systematic reviews aim at synthesising evidence and assessing the **strength of evidence***

*Systematic maps are primarily concerned with structuring a research area ("what is the evidence base for...?") to identify **gaps and gluts of evidence***

## Rapid review

[No agreed definition of a rapid review]{.underline}

Which corners to cut (not exhaustive)?

-   Span of the literature (e.g. post 2010 - present)

-   "Study quality" (e.g. only systematic reviews)

-   Number of reviewers (e.g. 1 person to review & 1 to check a %)

## 

Which corners **NOT** to cut?

-   ***Critical Appraisal - internal and external validity of the study***

    -   Does the study fit your question?

    -   Does the study answer the question it sets out to do?

    -   Does it have clear separation between control & exposure/intervention

### *Not all evidence is created equal!*

## Where to get help?

[Conservation Evidence](https://www.conservationevidence.com/) provides a database of interventions - this is a useful repository but is **NOT** ***Evidence Synthesis*** - it is a good starting point though.

## In NINA

Frode at the library & I are working on a [website](https://drmattg.github.io/Evidence_synthesis/) to help you decide which type of review to use.

## Collaboration for Environmental Evidence

[CEE](https://environmentalevidence.org/) have a dedicated training programme which is available for free [here](https://synthesistraining.github.io/) as well as [workshops](https://environmentalevidence.org/training-workshops/) that may have a cost associated with them.
